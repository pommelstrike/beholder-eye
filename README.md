# beholder-eye Client-side LSX file processor for updating XML-based .lsx files and to mitgate consoles from crashing and to prevent reddit babies from feeding toilet paper tier gaming journalist rags from writing about your mod with their bullshit 5th grade writing. The BHSD shaders and materialbank references point to it are automatically generated by default for anyone who creates a new resource, wheter or not the modder uses them. the absolut BALLS, to call that modders are doing this it done on purpose to paint the illsion the modder overlooked something. The Mod.io guides STILL DO NOT mention this! So i made this to ease modders in fixing their unknowning "bad shaders". I got lemons and am making sugar-free lemonade for everyone.
Materialbank parser for BG3 .lsx source files to redirect MOD KIT GENERATED project shaders to pre-packaged BG3 game shader for Game Console compatibility.

You know the drill, pull the .lsf files into LSLIB " LSF, to LSX, " tab from Data\Public\<ModName_UUID>\Assets 
Do not use BG3 mulittool as that is from the .pak, no use the .lsf from the Project folders as listed above.
The one piece is real.
