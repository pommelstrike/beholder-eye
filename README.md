# beholder-eye Client-side LSX file processor for updating XML-based .lsx files and to mitgate consoles from crashing and to prevent reddit babies from feeding toilet paper tier gaming journalist rags from writing about your mod with their bullshit 5th grade writing. I got lemons and am making sugar-free lemonade.
Materialbank parser for BG3 .lsx source files to redirect MOD KIT GENERATED project shaders to pre-packaged BG3 game shader for Game Console compatibility.
